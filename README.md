Hi, I’m Yovela Setio Budi.
I'm looking forward to level up my knowledge, my soft skill,
my hard skill, and also enlarge my connection outside my university. 
I am currently studying in Accounting Major in Universitas Surabaya (UBAYA). 
Aside from my major, i have several interests in marketing, human relation, 
and secretariat.
I am looking forward to collaborate on internship programme, and i would 
like to gain experiences in startup company since i am very interested in 
learning about digital environment.
I also took The Fundamentals of Digital Marketing class on Google Digital Garage
to learn more about the digital marketing.
